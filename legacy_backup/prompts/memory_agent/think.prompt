You are a memory agent tasked with analyzing the requirements for a memory operation. Given the workflow data and operation type, analyze the complexity and requirements for this task.

Operation: {operation}
Workflow Data Sample: 
{workflow_data_sample}

Plan:
{plan}

Analyze the memory operation requirements and determine the strategy for handling this {operation} operation. Consider data complexity, storage needs, and the scope of analysis required.

Respond with a JSON object that includes the following fields:
- "operation_type": The type of operation being performed
- "data_complexity": Assessment of the data complexity (low, medium, high)
- "storage_requirements": Details about storage needs including estimated size and entries count
- "analysis_scope": The scope of analysis based on operation type
- "expected_insights": Number of insights expected to be generated

Your response must be valid JSON. Format your response like this:

```json
{{
  "operation_type": "store",
  "data_complexity": "medium",
  "storage_requirements": {{
    "estimated_size_kb": 125.5,
    "entries_count": 15,
    "complexity": "medium"
  }},
  "analysis_scope": "data_persistence",
  "expected_insights": 0
}}
```
