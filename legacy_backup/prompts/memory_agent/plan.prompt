- "data_sources": Key data sources that will be used in this operation

Your response must be valid JSON. Format your response like this:

```json
{{
  "operation": "store",
  "phases": ["data_extraction", "entry_creation", "persistence", "validation"],
  "expected_duration": 300,
  "data_sources": ["agent1_data", "agent2_data"]
}}
```
