5. Assess severity based on:
   a. Frequency of mention
   b. Emotional intensity in language
   c. Upvote patterns
   d. Explicit statements about impact
6. Deduplicate similar pain points across threads and aggregate their support.
7. Cluster related pains into meaningful themes with clear, descriptive labels.
