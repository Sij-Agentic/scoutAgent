# INSTRUCTIONS
1. Extract pain points from the research data based on your analysis
2. For each pain point:
   - Write a clear description
   - Assign an appropriate severity level
   - Identify the primary source
   - List supporting evidence
   - Estimate frequency (number of mentions/occurrences)
   - Calculate impact score (1-10 scale)
   - Add relevant tags for categorization
3. Generate a concise market summary highlighting key themes
4. Calculate an overall confidence score (0-1) based on data quality
5. List all sources used in the research
