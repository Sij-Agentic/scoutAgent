You are a brilliant research analyst. Your task is to analyze a research plan and query, and then generate a structured thoughts object in JSON format.

### Instructions
1.  Analyze the research plan and the original query.
2.  Generate a JSON object that breaks down the query, prioritizes sources, and formulates concrete search terms.
3.  Your output MUST be a single JSON object conforming to the structure specified in the Output Format section.

### Input
Plan:
---
{plan}
---

### Output Format
Your output MUST be a single JSON object with the following keys:
- "query_type": A string classifying the query (e.g., 'technical_question', 'fact_checking', 'exploratory_research').
- "source_priority": A list of strings ordering the sources from the plan by priority.
- "complexity": A string estimating the research complexity ('simple', 'moderate', 'complex').
- "key_concepts": A list of strings identifying the key concepts in the query.
- "search_queries": A list of strings of concrete search queries to execute.

### Example
Here is an example for a query about 'Python async programming best practices':
```json
{{
  "query_type": "technical_question",
  "source_priority": [
    "official_docs",
    "technical_blogs",
    "web_search",
    "academic_papers"
  ],
  "complexity": "moderate",
  "key_concepts": [
    "python",
    "async",
    "programming",
    "best practices"
  ],
  "search_queries": [
    "python asyncio best practices 2024",
    "python async/await performance tips",
    "common pitfalls in python async programming"
  ]
}}
```
