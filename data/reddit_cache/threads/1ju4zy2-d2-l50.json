    "selftext": "I'm trying to get my notes and ideas organized digitally. I know about Evernote and Notion, but wondering what other note-taking or personal knowledge management (PKM) apps people find really effective? Looking for something possibly with good linking features (like Roam/Obsidian?), tagging, and available across devices (desktop/mobile). Open to free or paid options. What tools do you use and why do you like them? Thanks!"

EssentialPIM Pro works fine between Windows and Android, with local sync capability - but I would not consider the Notes module to be powerful enough to serve as a reference / research database.  (Does OK with shorter notes - but emphasis is on PIM functions of contacts, calendar, todo.)\n\nFor \"live\" notes, I have given up on mobile phone and simply use Word on a \"thin &amp; light\" laptop, saving to OneDrive.  But only take live notes a few times each month now: if something seems particularly important will import it into RightNote (see below) - otherwise just leave the word doc in a somewhat organized folder structure and rely on Copernic Desktop Search to find data as needed.  \n\nAs a Reference / Research Database, have been using RightNote Pro for over a decade and have not found anything that was Sufficiently \"Better\" to make it seem worth the effort to change over.  RN does not have an Android version, although it DOES have a good Export function, into a variety of file formats including html and \"Webbook\" - the latter of which works well on a chromebook or android tablet (larger screen than phone....).\n\nRN also worked with Evernote at one time - may still do, although I gave up on Evernote after a group of notes somehow got \"lost\" (along with pricing changes...).",
