    "selftext": "Hey everyone üëã\n\nI‚Äôm a solo founder who‚Äôs launched 5 SaaS products (and working on more), and I kept running into the same two problems:\n\n**1. Where do I find customers?**  \n**2. How do I market without spending all day on it?**\n\nTools like Brand24, Google Alerts, and others exist‚Ä¶ but they‚Äôre either too expensive, limit how many keywords you can track, or just dump a **wall of junk mentions** on you. You end up wasting hours reading irrelevant stuff, trying to guess if it‚Äôs worth replying.\n\nSo I built **MentionMind** \\- a system that tracks what people say across social media and websites‚Ä¶ **but adds smart filtering and AI summaries to save your time.**\n\nIt‚Äôs not just another noisy alert tool - it‚Äôs more like a quiet assistant that runs in the background and shows you only high-quality, relevant mentions, based on your goals.\n\n# Here‚Äôs what it does:\n\nüí∏ **No subscription** \\- one-time payment, because I hate monthly billing  \nüîç **Unlimited keywords** \\- no tracking limits  \nüîî **Real-time alerts** \\- see new mentions as they happen  \nüß† **AI summaries + lead quality scoring** \\- stop reading 20 tabs; know in seconds if a mention is worth your attention  \nüíª **Free API access** \\- for building your own automations\n\n**Just tell the system what kind of leads you‚Äôre looking for (in plain language)** \\- and it handles the filtering, relevance scoring, and summarizing for you.\n\nI use it daily to grow my SaaS projects, spot marketing opportunities, and monitor competitors - and early users are doing the same.\n\nIf you're working on something and want to know what people say about your niche or product, it might help you too.\n\nHappy to answer any questions or share what I‚Äôve learned.\n\nüëâ [mentionmind.com](https://mentionmind.com)"

      "body": "The real win is when MentionMind takes an interesting mention and instantly pushes a pre-filled outreach task into your workflow. I‚Äôd wire the API straight into something like HubSpot or even a simple Notion board via Zapier so every scored lead pops up with contact handle, context, and a next-step field. Pair that with a daily Slack digest clipped to the five highest scores and you never have to stare at dashboards. Make sure users can tweak the scoring rules-my niche punishes false positives harder than misses, so letting me bump down low-follower tweets or forums I never sell in is key. I‚Äôve bounced between Sparktoro for audience intel and PhantomBuster for scraping, but [APIWrapper.ai](http://APIWrapper.ai) is what stuck for stitching all the bits together cleanly. Nail that handoff and the one-time price will feel like a steal.",
