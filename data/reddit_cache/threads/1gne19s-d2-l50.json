[OpenPay](https://www.getopenpay.com/) helps automate several areas that are critical for subscription-based businesses:\n\n1. **Payment Orchestration**: OpenPay’s automated payment orchestration routes transactions through multiple processors, reducing failed payments and ensuring revenue continuity without manual intervention. This helps lower churn and keeps payments running smoothly.\n2. **Subscription Management**: Automate the entire subscription lifecycle—from onboarding and billing to renewals and plan upgrades. OpenPay’s platform manages changes in real time, so customers can adjust plans or update billing seamlessly, reducing the need for support.\n3. **Analytics**: Access real-time, automated insights into key metrics like churn, MRR, and customer behavior. OpenPay’s analytics dashboard provides the data you need to make informed decisions quickly, without the need for complex reporting setups.\n\nBy automating these processes, OpenPay lets teams focus on growth rather than day-to-day admin.",
