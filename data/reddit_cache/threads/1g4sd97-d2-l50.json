Same as sports car and truck are both cars, but for completely different purposes and with completely different capabilities. But actually it is an AI agent, which is a quite a new category and is fairly different than just a chatbot.\n2. there is a free trial for the purposes of testing\n3. For my website using it - actually it is a great idea, I haven't thought of that",
