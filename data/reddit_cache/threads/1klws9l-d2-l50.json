    "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nI run a well-established, one-man tech company that‚Äôs been operating for over 6 years, officially registered in the UK. My background is in software development and systems automation. Recently, I‚Äôve expanded into AI-powered automation workflows - helping small to medium-sized blue collar businesses (like cleaning agencies, plumbers, electricians, and hairdressers) improve how they handle communication with customers.\n\nThese businesses are often out on the job all day, missing 10+ calls daily - lost revenue. I've built AI agents that handle incoming calls, WhatsApp messages, emails, and customer follow-ups. Despite not being a natural salesperson, I‚Äôve already onboarded several paying clients in my local area through cold calling, and the interest has been unexpectedly high.\n\nWhat I‚Äôm Looking For:\n\nI'm now looking for a partner based in the UK who can sell and upsell these solutions to similar businesses. Ideally, you:\n\n    Are comfortable making 20‚Äì30 cold calls a day\n\n    Can identify and approach potential clients\n\n    Are tech-savvy enough to understand and discuss automated workflows with confidence\n\n    Have a strong interest in working with small businesses and solving real-world problems\n\nKey Details:\n\n    Business registration: UK\n\n    Location requirement: UK-based only, as understanding local SMEs and having the ability to communicate in the same time zone is crucial\n\n    Physical presence: The business is currently online-only; no physical office\n\n    Proposed arrangement: Flexible ‚Äì open to working as commission-based contractor initially, with potential to grow into a more formal partnership or director role\n\n    Capital investment: No upfront investment required at this stage\n\n    Currency: GBP (¬£)\n\n    What I bring: A scalable tech platform, automation expertise, working products, existing clients, and strong backend infrastructure\n\n    What I need from you: Sales drive, outreach skills, and the ability to communicate tech benefits in simple terms\n\n    Partner input: Yes, you‚Äôd have the ability to shape direction, provide feedback, and co-develop the sales approach and offering\n\n    Financials: I have early-stage financial records and simple projections. Happy to share with serious partners\n\nIf this sounds like your kind of opportunity, drop me a message. Let‚Äôs chat and see if we can build something great together."

I'm definitely not a sales person, so I think  for someone who could increase the volume of cold calls to 20-30 per day, and has more sales skills than me, this can really be a great business!",
