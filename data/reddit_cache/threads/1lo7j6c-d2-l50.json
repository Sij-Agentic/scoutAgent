      "body": "There are so many differences between professional knowledge and the things which we learn during the job. Like in the professional knowledge there are some standard ethics like how to talk to the senior, colleagues, junior, office workers which we should follow during the working time in the offices. In other words we can say that professional knowledge means the office culture but when we talk about the knowledge which we get during the job period is quite different. Like as it is mentioned in the office ethics might be different in the practical. So we should understand the differences between professional knowledge and the things we learn during the job period.",
