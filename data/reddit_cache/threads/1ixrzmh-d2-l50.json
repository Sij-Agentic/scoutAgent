From a business perspective it seems like a good idea, but from a consumer's perspective it's an absolute f\\*cking nightmare.\n\ni donâ€™t want ai-generated spam flooding my inbox and linkedin messages with fake personalization\n\ni donâ€™t want to talk to an ai chatbot when i need to reschedule my flight\n\ni donâ€™t want to receive ai-generated phone calls pretending to be human\n\ni donâ€™t want ai avatars flooding my social media feeds with soulless, generic \"influencer\" content\n\ni donâ€™t want ai responding to my customer support emails with copy-paste answers when i need real help\n\ni donâ€™t want ai answering my call at a restaurant when iâ€™m trying to make a reservation\n\ni donâ€™t want ai deciding who gets hired based on \"optimized\" but biased algorithms\n\nI also don't want ai agents to run my fucking business. \n\nSeriously. solve problems that actually need solving instead of just AI-ing everything."

I agree that if you have a problem with something (i.e. flight booking, a faulty product, etc.) you want to talk to an actual human being, so companies that try to push for AI in these areas will probably suffer from bad CX. However, I think it works really well when you're just browsing or asking exploratory questions. And it makes sense that you'd want to use AI here because these probably make a good  portion of what a customer support rep does in a day, and is mostly regurgitating the same stuff every time, so you free them up to talk to customer with actual problems.\n\nThe problem is companies/founders thinking that AI is going to completely replace human contact for them. They should be thinking the opposite. Replace the background processes and focus more time on talking to your customers.",

I was investigating a technical SAAS product and their home page had a chat box. I started asking questions and it came back with some really solid answers. I started to dig further into technical details and it's answers were phenomenally good, what I'd expect from a conversation with a real developer.\n\nLater in the day I returned to ask another question and this time took a little longer to type out my question. Before I could hit submit I saw a message saying that Jim had joined the chat. When I then hit submit the response was as you'd expect from a non-technical member of support - they had to get back to me... At that moment I longed to be chatting to the AI bot again.",
