    "selftext": "I have been thinking about how AI and automation can save time in small businesses. For example, a realtor I know automated how he shortlisted homes for clients which freed up hours every week and helped him focus more on closing deals. His sales doubled as a result.\n\nWhat kind of repetitive or time-consuming tasks do you face in your business? Have you tried any AI or automation tools? I am curious to hear what works or doesnâ€™t work for others."
