    "selftext": "As a solo founder, I was spending hours every week:  \n‚Ä¢ Finding leads  \n‚Ä¢ Writing cold emails  \n‚Ä¢ Following up manually (when I remembered)\n\nSo I built something to replace all of that.\n\nIt‚Äôs called **ElevateSells**, and it acts like a full-time sales assistant ‚Äî powered by AI.\n\nHere‚Äôs what it does:\n\n‚úÖ Finds leads based on your target market  \n‚úÖ Writes **personalized cold emails** (no templates, no {first\\_name} laziness)  \n‚úÖ Sends them at the right time  \n‚úÖ Follows up automatically, 100% hands-off  \n‚úÖ Tracks replies and meetings ‚Äî and learns what works\n\nThe whole thing feels like having an SDR who never sleeps, never forgets to follow up, and actually sounds human.\n\nMy goal wasn‚Äôt to build yet another ‚Äúsales tool‚Äù ‚Äî it was to *replace the part of the founder job I dreaded most* with something that just worked.\n\nRight now it‚Äôs running live on my own outreach ‚Äî and booking real meetings.\n\nIf you‚Äôre running a B2B startup and don‚Äôt want to waste time on manual prospecting, I‚Äôd be happy to show you how I set it up.\n\nFeedback, questions, or critiques are welcome üôå"
