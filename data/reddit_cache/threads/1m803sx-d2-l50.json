I've been lurking here trying to learn as much as I can, reading posts, watching videos, but figured asking directly might be the smartest move.\n\nWe‚Äôre planning to make a LinkedIn tutorial on **n8n** ‚Äì and we want to show real, useful automation examples. The goal is to help other tech folks or business teams save time by showing what *can* be automated.\n\nSo I‚Äôd love to hear from you:  \n**What are some of the most useful processes or workflows you've automated (or want to automate) using n8n?**\n\nBonus: We‚Äôre a software development services company, so if you have ideas from that world (like project management, lead gen, client onboarding, reporting, etc), even better!\n\nThanks a ton, I really appreciate your time!"

      "body": "I've been using n8n for about a year now and it's been a game changer for our lead gen processes. Here's what I'd definitely include in your tutorial.  \n  \nLead enrichment and scoring workflows  \n  \nSet up n8n to automatically enrich new leads from your website forms using [Apollo.io](http://Apollo.io) or ZoomInfo APIs. Then score them based on company size, industry, and job title before pushing them into your CRM. This way your sales team only gets qualified leads instead of random tire kickers.  \n  \nCold email follow up sequences  \n  \nConnect n8n to your email platform like Instantly AI to automatically send follow up emails based on engagement. If someone doesn't open your first email, wait 3 days then send a different angle. Lead Gen Jay talks about this stuff in his YouTube videos about email automation and it really works.  \n  \nClient onboarding automation  \n  \nOnce someone becomes a client, trigger a whole sequence that creates their project in your PM tool, sends welcome emails with next steps, schedules kickoff calls, and even generates contracts. We save like 2 hours per new client just with this workflow alone.  \n  \nThe key is starting simple with one process that actually bugs you every day. Don't try to automate everything at once or you'll get overwhelmed. What specific pain points are you trying to solve first? That'll help determine which workflows would be most valuable to show.",
