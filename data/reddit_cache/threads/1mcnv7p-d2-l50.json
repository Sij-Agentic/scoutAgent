    "selftext": "After tracking my productivity for 6 months, I realized I was spending 4+ hours daily on 'productivity theater' - organizing tasks, switching between apps, and managing my workflow instead of actually working. Here's exactly how I automated my way out of that trap.\n\n**The Big 3 Automations (80% of the impact):**\n\nðŸ”„ **Morning Brain Dump â†’ Prioritized Schedule**\n- Use Zapier to connect voice notes from my commute directly to Todoist\n- AI automatically categorizes and prioritizes based on deadlines + energy levels\n- Calendar blocks automatically created for top 3 priorities\n- **Time saved:** 45 minutes daily, **Focus gained:** Massive\n\nâš¡ **Context Switching Elimination** \n- Set up automated 'focus modes' that block distracting websites during deep work blocks\n- Phone automatically goes to DND with work-only exceptions\n- Slack/email only check at predetermined times (auto-responses set)\n- **Time saved:** 2+ hours daily of recovered focus time\n\nðŸ“Š **End-of-day Workflow Automation**\n- Automatically generate tomorrow's priorities based on today's incomplete tasks + calendar\n- Time-tracking data auto-analyzed to identify productivity patterns\n- Weekly review document auto-populated with key metrics\n- **Time saved:** 30 minutes daily, **Insight gained:** Huge\n\n**The Surprising Tools That Made the Difference:**\n\nâ€¢ **Zapier:** For connecting all my apps (totally worth the $20/month)\nâ€¢ **Motion:** AI calendar scheduling (game-changer for context switching)\nâ€¢ **TextExpander:** Automated responses and templates\nâ€¢ **IFTTT:** Simple phone/environment automations\n\n**Before vs After:**\n- **Before:** 6 productive hours, 4 hours of 'productivity overhead'\n- **After:** 10+ productive hours, 30 minutes of system maintenance\n- **ROI:** Tools cost ~$50/month, but I gained 20+ hours weekly\n\n**The key insight:** Automate the meta-work (organizing, planning, switching) so you can focus on the actual work.\n\nHappy to share specific workflows or answer questions about any of these automations!"
