    "selftext": "Let me share how I ended up building an automation tool for Facebook Marketplace Listing.\n\nBack in July 2024, I started selling random stuff around the house on Facebook Marketplace. First sale? A basketball I didn‚Äôt really use. Took good pics, wrote a nice title, posted it‚Äîand waited. Got a couple of messages. Meh.\n\nAbout a week later, Facebook said my listing had expired and needed to be renewed. While renewing, I got the option to share to groups. I picked 15 suggested groups.\n\nBoom. That same evening, 10 messages. 4 serious buyers. I was hooked.\n\nThat‚Äôs when I realized‚Äî**Facebook Marketplace + the right group strategy = üî•**\n\nSoon I was selling more: a carpet, an old phone, a cooker. All within a week. Later, I worked with a phone company that funded Facebook Ads. While ads got tons of engagement, **actual sales came from my Marketplace + Group efforts**.\n\nBut here‚Äôs the pain point...\n\nOnce you're trying to list more than 5‚Äì10 items daily, doing this manually is draining. Especially with sharing to multiple groups. That‚Äôs why I started building **Fbyebot**.\n\n**üí° What is Fbyebot?**\n\nA simple automation tool that helps Facebook sellers post faster and smarter.\n\n# ‚úÖ Features:\n\n* Auto-login to your FB account  \n* Auto-post listings (title, description, price, images)  \n* Batch upload products  \n* Post to multiple FB accounts  \n* Share listings to groups you're in  \n\n# üß† Why Use It?\n\n* Save 5‚Äì10+ hours/week  \n* Avoid human error  \n* Post more listings, faster  \n* Boost engagement + reach  \n* Increase your chances of making sales  \n\n**üéØ Who‚Äôs it for?**\n\n* Facebook resellers  \n* Dropshippers  \n* Small businesses scaling on FB  \n* Anyone tired of posting manually every day  \n\n\n\n# üîç Now I need your help\n\nI‚Äôve tested it with phones and cars so far. Curious‚Äîwhat *else* could this tool help sell better?\n\nIf you're selling on Facebook, through Ads, Marketplace, or Groups, give **Fbyebot** a shot and let me know what you think. I‚Äôm open to feedback‚Äîwhat to tweak, improve, or remove.\n\n# üßë‚Äçüíª Devs:\n\nHappy to share the source code if you want to play around with it.\n\n# üíå Want to try it out?\n\nShoot me a DM or email me at [yegonk247@gmail.com](mailto:yegonk247@gmail.com)¬† and I‚Äôll send it over."

Most of the things out there I've seen are mostly for Dropshipping only and we are going to be doing something a little different. So, for sure curious how your program works. Are you a full developer as well or is this something you kind of spun up? Thanks and looking forward to hearing from you.",

      "body": "Hi @Thorman77, first of all,  congratulations on your upcoming Business launch  and wishing you all the best. Secondly, I am grateful that you took the time to go through my post about my Facebook Marketplace Automation Software...glad you want to learn more about it. And yes, I like to think that it's because of my unique position of being in sales and marketing with a background in software development that enabled me to come up with this product.So, in a nutshell what this FB Marketplace Software does is, after you create a folder with your products and product description, which you will only do once. From there, all you will need is click on the software and it will automatically log in to your FB, go to FB marketplace, and start posting each of your products, then also share the listed products to more and more groups. All you will have to do from there is wait for messages and enquiries about your product and respond to them. If your business will be needing Facebook Marketplace, then I can Bet üíØ  that this software will definitely boost your business, increase your engagement, Sales and save you so much time. If you are open to it, I could give you a demo of how the software works and the results it produces. Then if you like what you will see, we can set it up for your Business too. Thanks and looking forward to hearing from you. Just DMed you.",
