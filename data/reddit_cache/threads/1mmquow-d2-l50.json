    "selftext": "&gt;I’ve been building a platform that makes automation as simple as filling a form and clicking “run.”\n\n&gt;The idea:\n\n* Devs post ready-to-use workflows (email scraping, auto-social posting, data extraction, etc.)\n* Users run them without seeing the backend logic\n* Devs get paid every time someone uses their workflow\n\n&gt;Why I built it:\n\n* Zapier/Make are powerful but have a steep learning curve for non-tech users\n* Devs often don’t have a marketplace to easily sell their automations\n\n&gt;Would love your feedback — what workflows would *you* want in a push-button format?"
