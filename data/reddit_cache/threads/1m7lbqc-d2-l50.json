    "selftext": "Hey everyone!\n\nI‚Äôve been in SEO/marketing for almost 20 years, launched over a hundred websites, and driven millions of sessions from search. I keep seeing the same gap:\n\n* People can build a SaaS (accelerated moreso by vibe coding/AI)\n* But they struggle to pick a ***DATA BACKED*** idea and create a real marketing strategy that drives traffic\n\nWith AI, it‚Äôs gotten super easy to actually *build* software, but I still see a lot of struggles with people marketing it.\n\nSo - I am thinking of building a DB or DFY service around this. I‚Äôve seen other DBs that just have **just the idea by itself**, so this would be going substantially further with the value add. So this post is to test and see if this is something anyone here would find useful.\n\nI have found hundreds of relatively untapped and growing niches for software &amp; physical products, but honestly, my favorite part is finding them and planning it all out. Once I have to actually build the thing‚Ä¶ eh.\n\nThat‚Äôs why I think selling this as a service or ‚Äòdatabase‚Äô could be beneficial to everyone.\n\nThis service would include:\n\n**Ideation / Research**\n\n* Trend spotting &amp; analysis\n* SEO Keyword research\n* ICP &amp; Persona Profiles\n* Comp Identification\n* Elevator pitch/Positioning\n* USP\n* Ideal and MVP Feature Set\n* Value Prop\n\n**Foundations &amp; Assets**\n\n* Domain Name (Verified Available)\n* Branding (logos, colors, style, etc) - 3 Options\n* LP Copy (w/ multiple split test variants)\n* Lead magnet creation\n* 100 DRIP campaign emails\n\n**Content &amp; Engagement**\n\n* Topical Map for SEO (100-1000+ pages, posts, w/ interlinking and pillars)\n* Content Calendar (1-2 years typical)\n* Writing prompts for all content\n* Finished articles\n* 3 Months of Social Posts (twitter/linkedin/TT/IG/where ICP is)\n* List of 100+ places to launch\n\nBelow I‚Äôve outlined a new trending **DATA BACKED** SaaS idea that people are ***actually searching*** for today. But of course, building the thing isn‚Äôt *all that hard* (probably), so below that is marketing strategy with a focus on the elusive inbound organic search-based traffic (from google).\n\nLet‚Äôs take a look‚Ä¶\n\n# AI Music Generator\n\nThis one is great because there are multiple search queries that show various uses and intents (lots of use cases and multiple USPs). Instead of outlinking to a report, I will just put everything in this post. If this is useful and I want to do another I might just link to a g doc or something.\n\n# Ideation / Research\n\n*Data from SEMRush*\n\nTotal # of keywords:¬†\n\n**8,579**\n\nTotal Search Volume:\n\n**322,030**\n\nAverage Keyword Difficulty:\n\n**53 / 100**\n\nNow, where this one shines is in the sub-niches and use cases. A generic AI Music Generator won‚Äôt cut it - it‚Äôs too competitive. So after digging around for a bit I found these:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zjdkc169woef1.png?width=562&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9e814e909f97763040a7e309ba3decadbdbc9928\n\nVarious USPs and angles we could go after with ***real people*** already searching for them on google. You could honestly pick any of these and get cracking.\n\nLet‚Äôs take a deeper look into ‚Äòai sheet music generator‚Äô. We want to get several things here - an ICP, USP, value prop, MVP feature set, and all the other stuff I mentioned above. For brevity, I‚Äôll ask chatgpt to summarize the much longer research I originally have.\n\n# ICP &amp; Persona Profiles\n\nTarget users are **composers/producers**, **music educators/students**, and **hobbyists/songwriters** who need fast transcription, creative idea capture, or personalized learning materials. Personas include *Alex (Film Composer)*, *Dr. Carter (Teacher)*, and *Emma (Hobbyist Pianist)*.\n\n# Competitor Identification\n\nKey players: **AnthemScore**, **ScoreCloud**, **Melody Scanner**, **Klangio**, **Remusic AI**, and **Songscription**. Most offer transcription but lack combined **accuracy, ease-of-use, and creative generation**, leaving room for an all-in-one solution.\n\n# Elevator Pitch / Positioning\n\n‚ÄúAn AI-powered sheet music generator that instantly turns audio or ideas into clean, editable scores‚Äîperfect for musicians, teachers, and creators who want speed, accuracy, and creativity in one tool.‚Äù\n\n# USP (Unique Selling Proposition)\n\nThe only platform that combines **multi-instrument transcription**, **AI-powered composition assistance**, and **intuitive editing/export**‚Äîbridging the gap between notation software and generative music AI.\n\n# Ideal &amp; MVP Feature Set\n\n**Ideal:** Multi-track transcription, AI melody/chord generation, integrated editor, educational aids, and DAW/plugin support. **MVP:** Upload or record audio ‚Üí instant sheet music + simple editor + PDF/MusicXML export.\n\n# Value Proposition\n\nEliminates tedious manual transcription, accelerates creative workflow, and democratizes music creation for all skill levels‚Äîmaking professional-quality notation accessible in seconds.\n\n# Foundations &amp; Assets\n\nNext up we need all the branding, landing page copy, lead mag, emails, etc.\n\n# Domain\n\nWhile [sheetmusic.io](http://sheetmusic.io) is actually available for $13,000, I think a better option is [sheetmusicgenerator.ai](http://sheetmusicgenerator.ai) or [sheetmusicmaker.io](http://sheetmusicmaker.io) and then maybe buy the more expensive domain down the road üòâ.\n\nThese are currently available, but might get taken once this post goes live (which would be great!)\n\n# Logo Ideas\n\nSome simple and varying in style logos. I like #1 personally‚Ä¶\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rf7sn4vgvoef1.jpg?width=1092&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b48f039ee820a28b153eabf18b58403eaa39112d\n\n# Color Palette\n\nPrimary: Deep Navy (#1E2A38)\n\nAccent: Electric Purple (#7F5AF0)\n\nSecondary: White (#FFFFFF) &amp; Silver Gray (#E5E7EB)\n\n# Typography\n\nCan‚Äôt go wrong with the tried and true - Poppins &amp; Roboto üòÅ\n\n# MVP LP Copy\n\nPreheadline: Stop Wasting Hours on Manual Transcription\n\nHeadline: **Turn Any Melody Into Professional Sheet Music - In Seconds**\n\nPostheadline: *(Even If You Can‚Äôt Read Music or Play an Instrument!)*\n\nHero CTA:\n\n\\[ Generate Your First Score Free ‚Üí \\]\n\nNo credit card required.

Offer stack that with a mini-course on music transcription (using your own tool, ofc) would bring in leads.\n\n# Drip Campaign\n\nThis is to convert those above leads into buyers. I‚Äôd go the standard 100 emails, 2/week over a year. Value, Value, Value, Pitch is tested in many markets. You can always go harder on the pitch, but I prefer softer.\n\nI‚Äôll just put 1 value and 1 pitch here for brevity‚Ä¶ The value emails should be short, useful, and not mention your tool at all (except in the sig)\n\nSubject: **5 Proven Hacks to Master Transcription Faster**\n\nHey \\[Name\\],\n\nTranscribing music by ear can feel overwhelming, but these 5 tips make it easier:\n\n1. Start with the Bass Line\n\nLow notes anchor the harmony. Once you have the root movement, chords become predictable.\n\n1. Slow It Down\n\nUse a slowdown tool (e.g., Transcribe!, Anytune) and drop tempo to 50% without changing pitch.\n\n1. Work in Sections\n\nBreak the song into 4-bar chunks. Accuracy skyrockets when you isolate phrases.\n\n1. Sing Before You Write\n\nHumming the phrase reinforces pitch memory and reduces errors when you notate.\n\n1. Check Against Common Progressions\n\nMost pop and jazz tunes use predictable chord progressions (I-V-vi-IV, ii-V-I). If notes fit a common pattern, you‚Äôre probably on track.\n\nApply these today and you‚Äôll cut transcription time in half.\n\nStay creative,\n\n\\[Your Name\\]\n\n[sheetmusicgenerator.ai](http://sheetmusicgenerator.ai)\n\nSubject: **Shortcut Your Next Transcription (Here‚Äôs How)**\n\nBody:\n\nHey \\[Name\\],\n\nEven with great techniques, transcription still takes time - especially for complex songs. That‚Äôs why musicians are looking for ways to automate the tedious part, so they can focus on the fun: playing, teaching, &amp; creating.\n\nImagine uploading a quick recording and seeing perfect sheet music appear in seconds, ready to edit and share.\n\nSound like something you‚Äôd use?\n\n[**Try It Free Here**](http://sheetmusicgenerator.ai)\n\nCreate more, stress less.\n\n\\[Your Name\\]\n\n[sheetmusicgenerator.ai](http://sheetmusicgenerator.ai)\n\n# Content &amp; Engagement\n\n# Topical Map\n\nNow let‚Äôs get the topical map from the keywords. This is important to show google that the site is an authority and know what the hell it‚Äôs talking about. Since we are building an ai sheet music generator, we want to cover as much as we can about sheet music (which is quite a lot!). There‚Äôs 800k keywords mentioning sheet music, so I will filter, cluster, and map these down.\n\nAfter that, we‚Äôre left with still several thousand pages for the site. I will typically launch a site with 100-300 posts and publish 2-3 per day for 2+ years.\n\nInstead of listing out every single page topic here, I‚Äôll give you just 1 pillar and it‚Äôs children:\n\nPillar (links to all children): **clarinet sheet music‚Äã (volume 5400, kd 16)**\n\nChildren (all link back to pillar):¬†\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mbqnh07cwoef1.png?width=567&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2cbedb3cd40cc4d8eb2284f6c13abc8474287262\n\n***Plus an additional 100 or so‚Ä¶***\n\nI absolutely love this because we can actually *use our own tool* to create these pages. You want jingle bells sheet music for clarinet? Here it is made by our own tool! Perfect.\n\n# Writing Prompts\n\nA topical map is pretty useless unless you actually have the content made. Each page will need a writing prompt to hand off to a human writer (or AI).\n\nFor example‚Ä¶\n\nTarget Keyword: jingle bells clarinet sheet music\n\nGoal: Create an engaging, SEO-friendly blog post that helps clarinet players find and use ‚ÄúJingle Bells‚Äù sheet music for the holidays. The post should provide value by including helpful tips, background, and resources.\n\nWorking Title Ideas:\n\n‚ÄúFree Jingle Bells Clarinet Sheet Music + Play-Along Tips‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúHow to Play Jingle Bells on Clarinet: Free Sheet Music Inside‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúJingle Bells Clarinet Sheet Music (Free Download + Easy Guide)‚Äù\n\nSections to Include:\n\n**Introduction (100-150 words)**\n\nIntroduce the popularity of Jingle Bells during the holiday season.\n\nExplain why it‚Äôs a great piece for clarinet players (easy melody, festive mood, fun for beginners/intermediate players).\n\nMention that the post includes free sheet music and tips.\n\n**About Jingle Bells (50-100 words)**\n\nShort history of the song (composed by James Lord Pierpont in 1857).\n\nIts significance as a Christmas classic and why it‚Äôs loved by musicians.\n\n**Clarinet Sheet Music Overview (150-200 words)**\n\nDescribe the range and key signature for clarinet (usually in Bb).\n\nMention common arrangements (beginner, intermediate, full band).\n\nSuggest tempo and style for best performance.\n\nFree Jingle Bells Clarinet Sheet Music Download\n\nProvide the link to download or create using the software\n\nInclude an image of the first few bars as a preview.\n\n**Tips for Playing Jingle Bells on Clarinet (150-200 words)**\n\nBreathing and phrasing tips.\n\nHow to handle the repeats and syncopation in the chorus.\n\nSuggestions for playing with backing tracks or a piano.\n\n**Optional: Play-Along Resources**\n\nEmbed a play-along video or audio.\n\nMention key transpositions if playing with other instruments.\n\n**Conclusion + Call to Action**\n\nEncourage readers to download the sheet music, share with friends, and check out related Christmas sheet music.\n\nAdd internal links to clarinet sheet music page and other Christmas music or clarinet tutorials.\n\n**Tone &amp; Style:**\n\nFriendly, instructional, and holiday-spirited.\n\nUse short paragraphs and bullet points where helpful.\n\nInclude SEO keyword variations naturally (e.g., ‚Äúclarinet sheet music for Jingle Bells,‚Äù ‚Äúfree Jingle Bells clarinet music‚Äù).\n\nWord Count: 800-1,000 words.\n\nSEO Tips:\n\nInclude the main keyword in the title, first paragraph, one H2 heading, and image alt text.\n\nAdd related keywords like: Christmas clarinet songs, beginner clarinet sheet music, free Christmas sheet music.\n\n# Written articles\n\nThis is pretty straight forward - you need content on the site. It doesn‚Äôt have to be insanely high quality (especially for this difficulty level) so AI + human editor could go pretty far here.\n\nThe service would also cover creating all this (price would vary on human vs ai written, ofc)\n\n# 3 Months of Social Posts\n\nTbh, I think TikTok might be the play here. Cross posting on IG/YT shorts as well. Just short videos showing the tool in action and then maybe a ‚Äòplay along‚Äô or something could be great. Focus on doing popular songs or the high volume search terms from the KW research first..¬†\n\nYou can also go linkedin to grab professionals in education/production.\n\nShort reels to showcase the product and linkedin for start convos.\n\n**Viral Shorts Script:**\n\nHook (0-3s):\n\nText on screen: ‚ÄúHate writing sheet music? Watch this.‚Äù\n\nAudio: Trending song.\n\nBody (3-25s):\n\nShow yourself (or screen recording): ‚ÄúI just hummed this melody‚Ä¶‚Äù\n\nPlay a short hum or sing snippet (3-4 sec).\n\nCut to your tool‚Äôs interface: Upload ‚Üí Generate ‚Üí Boom!\n\nShow clean sheet music appearing. Add on-screen text: ‚ÄúAI did this in 10 sec.‚Äù\n\nCTA (25-30s):\n\nVoiceover: ‚ÄúTry it free on any song you want‚Äù\n\n**LinkedIn Post:**\n\n*Music teachers: personalize learning without adding hours to your workload.*\n\nOne of the hardest parts of teaching music is **creating exercises for** ***different*** **skill levels**. It‚Äôs time-consuming and repetitive.\n\nHere‚Äôs an approach some teachers are testing: üéµ Start with a single melody üéµ Use AI to transpose or simplify for each student üéµ Export, print, and you‚Äôre done\n\nIt‚Äôs not about replacing you - it‚Äôs about freeing up time for real teaching moments.Curious what other educators think:Would you trust AI to generate practice material? Or do you prefer traditional methods?\n\n# List of 100+ places to launch\n\nThese are useful for not only traffic, but backlinks!\n\nObviously all the big places like HN, IH, PH, etc, but also subreddits like r/musictheory and r/AudioProduction could be a solid hit.\n\nFurther lesser known places that are music niched: Stage32, VI-Control Forum, Composer Focus, Noteflight Community, Flat.io Community, MusicTech.net, and a bunch more.¬†\n\nPR Packages are usually a nice play as well.\n\n# Overall\n\nThanks for reading and I hope you end up taking this idea and running with it!¬†\n\nThis took me a couple of weeks to put together (I reduced a ton of other info so it would fit in this post), so if you could do me a favor and just let me know in the comments or dm:\n\n1. Would you pay for a service or database like this? If so, what‚Äôs a fair price?\n2. What part do you find most beneficial?\n\nThanks again and have a great day!\n\nJay"
