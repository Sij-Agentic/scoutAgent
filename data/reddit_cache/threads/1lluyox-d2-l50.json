    "selftext": "I have around 15 years of product and technology experience. \n\nI am looking to build a productized SaaS agency that provides e-commerce solutions so that e-commerce store can increase their revenue and customer satisfaction.\n\nI will do this by building n8n workflow automation across their entire set of system and tools and creating a Revops dashboard for tracking.\n\n\nI am looking for someone from UK or USA who has done some business development in past for e-commerce and together we can build something really nice for e-commerce store to help them 5x their cost spent on us.\n\nI am thinking of 3 monthly plans like $500 for basic ai Automation, $2500 for advanced automation and then custom pricing plan.\n\nWe would reach to only Shopify store above $300k annual revenue.\n\n "
