    "selftext": "Years of hard work, struggle and pain. 20 failed projects ðŸ˜­\n\nBuilt it in a few days using Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, Digital Ocean, OpenAI, Kamal, etc...\n\nLessons:\n\n* Solve real problems (e.g, save them time and effort, make them more money). Focus on the pain points of your target customers. Solve 1 problem and do it really well.\n* Prefer to use the tools that you already know. Donâ€™t spend too much time thinking about what are the best tool to use. The best tool for you is the one you already know. Your customers won't care about the tools you used, what they care about is you're solving the problem that they have.\n* Start with the MVP. Don't get caught up in adding every feature you can think of. Start with a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that solves the core problem, then iterate based on user feedback.\n* Know your customer. Deeply understand who your customer is and what they need. Tailor your messaging, product features, and support to meet those needs specifically.\n* Fail fast. Validate immediately to see if people will pay for it then move on if not. Don't over-engineer. It doesn't need to be scalable initially.\n* Be ready to pivot. If your initial idea isn't working, don't be afraid to pivot. Sometimes the market needs something different than what you originally envisioned.\n* Data-driven decisions. Use data to guide your decisions. Whether it's user behavior, market trends, or feedback, rely on data to inform your next steps.\n* Iterate quickly. Speed is your friend. The faster you can iterate on feedback and improve your product, the better you can stay ahead of the competition.\n* Do lots of marketing. This is a must! Build it and they will come rarely succeeds.\n* Keep on shipping ðŸš€ Many small bets instead of 1 big bet.\n\n**Playbook that what worked for me (will most likely work for you too)**\n\nThe great thing about this playbook is it will work even if you don't have an audience (e.g, close to 0 followers, no newsletter subscribers etc...).\n\n**1. Problem**\n\nCan be any of these:\n\n* Scratch your own itch.\n* Find problems worth solving. Read negative reviews + hang out on X, Reddit and Facebook groups.\n\n**2. MVP**\n\nSet an appetite (e.g, 1 day or 1 week to build your MVP).\n\nThis will force you to only build the core and really necessary features. Focus on things that will really benefit your users.\n\n**3. Validation**\n\n* Share your MVP on X, Reddit and Facebook groups.\n* Reply on posts complaining about your competitors, asking alternatives or recommendations.\n* Reply on posts where the author is encountering a problem that your product directly solves.\n* Do cold and warm DMs.\n\nOne of the best validation is when users pay for your MVP.\n\nWhen your product is free, when users subscribe using their email addresses and/or they keep on coming back to use it.\n\n**4. SEO**\n\nROI will take a while and this requires a lot of time and effort but this is still one of the most sustainable source of customers. 2 out of 3 of my projects are already benefiting from SEO. I'll start to do SEO on my latest project too.\n\nThat's it! Simple but not easy since it still requires a lot of effort but that's the reality when building a startup especially when you have no audience yet.\n\nLeave a comment if you have a question, I'll be happy to answer it.\n\nP.S. The SaaS that I built is aÂ [tool that automates finding customers](https://customerfinderbot.com/)Â from social media. Basically saves companies time and effort since it works 24/7 for them. Built it to scratch my own itch and surprisingly companies started paying for it when I launched the MVP and it now grew to hundreds of customers from different countries, most are startups."
