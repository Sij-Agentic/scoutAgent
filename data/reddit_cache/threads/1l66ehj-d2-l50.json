    "selftext": "Hey everyone üëã\n\nI recently built an automated system that takes a LinkedIn profile and scores it based on how closely it matches your Ideal Customer Profile (ICP). It uses:\n- n8n for workflow automation\n- Google Gemini (or ChatGPT) for smart analysis\n- Airtop to enrich profile data from LinkedIn\n- Supabase for backend structure\n\n‚úÖ No scraping  \n‚úÖ No forms  \n‚úÖ Just a URL ‚Üí score + smart action\n\nBuilt originally to automate my own lead qualification process‚Ä¶ but now I‚Äôm wondering:\n\n- Would this solve a real pain for others?  \n- What kind of people would actually pay for this?  \n- Should this stay a private stack or evolve into a full public product?\n\nCurious what you think.\n\n#SaaS #LeadGeneration #B2BMarketing #Automation #n8n #ChatGPT #GoogleGemini #AItools #LinkedInGrowth #NoCode"

That means a lot coming from someone who‚Äôs also building in this space.\nI completely agree ‚Äî real-time validation and mapping actual pain points is often the missing link in early-stage SaaS.\nOut of curiosity:\n\t‚Ä¢\tHow are you currently capturing user intent signals or validating assumptions dynamically?\n\t‚Ä¢\tAre you focusing on qualitative input (like user interviews) or automated behavioral indicators?\n\t‚Ä¢\tAnd how do you decide what ‚Äúpain‚Äù is worth solving before committing to a full build?\n\nThese are the kinds of blind spots I‚Äôm trying to engineer around in my automation models",
