    "selftext": "Hey Reddit,\n\nI‚Äôm 36, originally from India and have been in the US since 2013 on an H1B visa. After a decade of dealing with corporate bureaucracy and soul-crushing tech sales (managing upwards and all that bootlicking‚Äîugh), I finally got my green card in the summer of 2023.\n\nI‚Äôve always hated trading time for money doing work I don‚Äôt care about. So, I‚Äôve decided to take a leap. My wife and I are heading to India soon for six weeks with our 3-month-old baby. She quit her job in July, and we‚Äôve been gearing up for a big shift in our lives.\n\nFinancially, we‚Äôre in a decent spot‚Äîwe can cover our expenses for two years without dipping into retirement savings. With that safety net, I‚Äôm planning to leverage my knowledge of the US market, my network in India, and my background in tech and business to explore these three industries:\n\n1.\tLab-Grown Diamond Imports ‚Äì Leveraging India‚Äôs expertise in diamond manufacturing and finding markets in the US.\n\n2.\tTextile Imports &amp; B2B Wholesale ‚Äì Starting with Amazon FBA and eventually building a brand (long-term vision here).\n\n3.\tCountertop &amp; Tile Imports ‚Äì Focused on B2B sales to US customers.\n\nI know these are all pretty different, but I‚Äôm hoping one of them clicks. I‚Äôm excited (and honestly, a little terrified) about taking the plunge into entrepreneurship after being in Corporate America my entire career.\n\nWish me luck! Am I crazy for leaving the relative ‚Äúsafety‚Äù of corporate America, or is this the leap I‚Äôve always needed to take? Would love to hear your thoughts, advice, or success stories from anyone who‚Äôs done something similar!\n\n Edit : I am dropping 1 and 2- going all in on #3"

Amazon FBA is hard these days, you need to sink at least 100-200k into it to replace your tech salary. In 2-3 years. If the FBA profit margin is say 10%, you need 4-5m worth of revenue. All the FBA niches are saturated. Countertop and tile - look at rates and countervailing duty rates if you are doing import export and how the next admin will impact you. There is a lot of opportunity in these markets where you don‚Äôt go direct to consumer - maybe builders or contractors? With your tech background, why not combine them and do 3d mockups of what builders want and then package/manufacture in India? Basically blue collar work is expensive in the US, but cheap overseas, the design/custom fab part is where the price delta comes from - iterate on that?",

Right now, it‚Äôs more about escaping your corporate job than proving that your idea has early, measurable success.\n\nWhen you decide to go all in, it should be on evidence of traction. Betting on a dream is gambling, not strategy‚Äîthough it may feel the same. The difference lies in whether you‚Äôve validated your ideas with real data or just hope for a positive outcome.\n\nApproach this like any other project: gather early evidence, validate your assumptions, and use that proof to fuel your decisions. Don‚Äôt let your business become an escape hatch; let it be a well-thought-out venture.\n\nAs for books, here are a few that can help shape that mindset:\n\n- *The Lean Startup* by Eric Ries\n\n- *Zero to One* by Peter Thiel\n\n* *The Innovator‚Äôs Dilemma*¬†by Clayton Christensen\n\n- *The Hard Thing About Hard Things* by Ben Horowitz\n\n- *The Art of the Start* 2.0 by Guy Kawasaki\n\n- *Nail It, Then Scale It* by Nathan Furr and Paul Ahlstrom\n\nThese books are good reads for your because they all, in different ways, emphasize evidence-based decision-making, traction, and avoiding the pitfalls of entrepreneurial dreams without validation.\n\nI teach a lot of people how to validate their business ideas, and it really does make a big difference to success and failure in early stage companies.¬†\n\nRemember you are a business in search of a business model, and we invest in evidence.
