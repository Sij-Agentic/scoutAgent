Main Orchestrator Workflow\n\n* Central controller for all automations\n* Switches categories dynamically\n* Triggers the right LLM logic &amp; templates\n* Dispatches to different social media upload flows\n\n# üì§ 2. Upload Workflow\n\n* Updates the Baserow DB\n* Uploads to Google Drive\n* Posts to YouTube (+ automatic playlisting)\n* Uploads to TikTok &amp; Instagram via [upload-post.com](https://upload-post.com/)\n* Easily extendable to other platforms\n\n# üé¨ 3. Intro / Scene / Metadata Generator\n\n* Includes a Supervisor LLM layer + Postfilter ‚Üí cleans up unsafe or overly long prompt output\n* Uses a master system prompt with dynamic Baserow variables for style, voice, tone, etc.\n* Scene count, duration, and content type all configurable per category\n\n# üí° 4. Automated Idea Generation\n\n* Scrapes trending content from niche sources\n* Picks random categories\n* Generates 10 raw ideas, then filters the top 5\n* Final idea JSON is stored in Baserow, ready for production\n\n# üìä 5. YouTube Metrics Collector\n\n* Pulls views, likes, copyright strikes, comment stats etc.\n* Ready for visualizations or trend detection\n\n# üêø 6. Special: Reddit Video Scraper\n\n* Targets specific subreddits\n* Downloads, trims &amp; stores clips in local S3 (MiniO)\n* Uses yt-dlp + custom tools to generalize &amp; merge footage\n* Creates compilations from similar clips via metadata matching\n\n# üí¨ 7. YouTube Auto-Reply Bot\n\n* Triggered by email\n* Analyzes new comments, stores to DB, and replies automatically\n\n# üí∏ 8. Affiliate Promo System\n\n* Dynamically injects call-to-actions into descriptions &amp; comments\n* Supports rotating campaigns &amp; evergreen default content\n* All managed via Baserow\n\n# üß∑ 9. Auto-Affiliate Comment Drop\n\n* First comment on every video is automatically posted\n* Uses clean formatting &amp; emoji-based bulletpoints\n\n# üì± 10. Shortform &amp; Longform Video Support\n\n* Two separate JSON2VIDEO templates (9:16 and 16:9)\n* Dynamically controlled scene count\n* Great for cinematic Shorts or long-form storytelling videos\n\nEverything is **100% automated** ‚Äî once a video idea lands in Baserow, the rest is handled by the system.  \nI‚Äôm still improving and experimenting (and soon launching this as a product on Gumroad).\n\nAtm. I'll spend like 60 cents per shorts video!\n\nIf you‚Äôre building anything similar or want to chat about video automation / monetization, happy to connect!  \nLet me know if you'd like to get notified when the full version launches.\n\nExamples:  \n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RyhsCeU\\_AsY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RyhsCeU_AsY)  \n[https://www.youtube.com/shorts/IWUdHIOyYyA](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/IWUdHIOyYyA)\n\nüí° Feedback, suggestions, or questions welcome!"
