    "selftext": "I create a lot of content based on what I learn from YouTube, SEO content, marketing breakdowns, AI tutorials...But turning those into notes, let alone blog posts or tweets, used to mean hours of copying, pasting, and rewording transcripts manually.\n\nI ended up building a tool to automate that, it’s called TubeMemo. Summary, transcript, key quotes, generate SEO blog post based on video content\n\nIf you repurpose video content or take heavy notes, I’d love to hear what tools or tricks you use.   \n  \nI’m the founder and open to building in features if you’ve got ideas."
