I recently tested VoiceHub by DataQueue for similar needs, and it handled basic queries like order status and returns pretty smoothly. The voice sounded surprisingly natural, and it didn’t drop calls during testing. Might be worth a look if you’re exploring budget friendly options. Hope that helps, and good luck",
