      "body": "My go-to stack looks like this:\n\n* **ChatGPT** for generating content (social posts, scripts, summaries)\n* [**Make.com**](http://Make.com) as the automation engine to connect everything\n* [**bookoly**](https://bookoly.com) to turn content into videos with voice-over, subtitles, and music\n* **Google Sheets** or **Airtable** as the content hub\n* Then auto-publish to different platforms (social media, blog, etc.)\n\nIt’s been a huge time-saver. Once the initial setup is done, I can go from idea to multi-platform content in minutes. The key for me was keeping the system flexible — one good prompt in ChatGPT can feed the whole chain.\n\nWould love to hear how others are approaching this too!",
