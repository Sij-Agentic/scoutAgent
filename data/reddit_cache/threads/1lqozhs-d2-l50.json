Industry experts consistently point to two root causes: **failed onboarding** and **losing the internal champion**. Venture capitalist David Skok notes that in practice \\*two causes of churn occur more frequently than any others\\* – namely, inability to get customers launched successfully, and the loss of the person who drove the purchase. Research backs this up: about **50% of all churn occurs in the first 60–90 days**, usually because new users never see real value. Likewise, if your internal power user or sponsor leaves, ChurnZero finds roughly a 51% chance the account will churn within a year (and 65% if it’s a senior exec). In 2025’s competitive SaaS landscape, fixing these issues can dramatically improve retention and sustainable growth.\n\n  \n**Why Onboarding is Crucial for Retention**\n\nOnboarding – the period when a new customer first starts using your product – is make-or-break. If you don’t deliver quick wins, users get frustrated or bored and \\*ghost\\* you. For example, over half of early customer churn is tied to a weak onboarding experience. In many cases, customers churn *not* because of missing features but because they \\*never saw the promised value\\* fast enough. Put simply, customers buy SaaS to solve problems, and if they don’t see impact quickly, they assume the solution isn’t working.\n\n\n\n**Time-to-Value (TTV) is a critical metric here.** GuideCX reports that the faster customers experience the initial value of your product, the more likely they are to stay satisfied. Conversely, new users who don’t see value early often become dissatisfied and churn. In practice, this means the sooner a customer reaches a meaningful milestone (even a small “win”), the more engaged they remain. Getting customers confidently past the hurdles in the first days/weeks significantly reduces \\*failure-to-launch\\* churn, while a clunky start guarantees many will drop off.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q49p1b59qnaf1.png?width=754&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=11bc702227743c3a2d572219d12151c49e640d8d\n\n* Prioritize **Time-to-Value (TTV)**. Design onboarding around the customer’s desired outcome, not a laundry list of features. Set up the 1–3 key wins they need first. When users see results in days or weeks (not months), they stay engaged.\n* **Measure business impact**, not just activity. Ask customers if they’re getting the benefits they expected. Simply tracking logins or feature usage isn’t enough. If they report real gains, churn risk plummets.\n\nGetting onboarding right is a fast path to higher retention. A smooth, outcome-focused kickoff reassures customers that your product delivers.\n\n  \n**Onboarding Best Practices to Lock In Customers**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4uadidfxnnaf1.png?width=886&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e9c14b4ecb8146a8e603fbd3e43235c4f5080efe\n\nLeading SaaS teams apply a mix of automation and personal touch to guide new users effectively:\n\n* **Automated Task Flows + Nudges:** Break the onboarding process into clear steps (checklists or plays) and automate reminders for each step. For example, if a user misses a setup task, trigger an email or an in-app prompt. This keeps customers on track without waiting for manual intervention.\n* **Timely Human Touch:** Combine automation with personal outreach. When key steps are stalled, have a Customer Success Manager (CSM) jump in. For high-value clients, schedule check-ins at critical milestones. In practice, a data-driven process that alerts CSMs to common roadblocks leads to faster issue resolution. For instance, Ollie (an ERP for breweries) used automated onboarding checklists *plus* targeted CSM check-ins; this mix \\*transformed their onboarding results, leading to lower churn and fewer failure-to-launch issues\\*\n* **Real-Time Health Signals:** Track engagement indicators – logins, feature usage, support tickets, NPS scores, etc. Set up a health score that flags accounts with low activity or rising issues. This lets you spot at-risk customers early and intervene proactively (e.g. send tips, offer training, or escalate to a CSM). SmartReach, for example, created a weighted health-score model that triggered alerts for at-risk accounts, enabling timely outreach.\n* **Ongoing Value Checks:** Don’t set it and forget it after onboarding. Regularly ask new customers if they’re meeting their goals. A quick survey or call within the first 30–60 days can reveal misalignments. If they aren’t seeing value, adjust the plan (change use case, add training, etc.). Catching misalignment early often saves an account from slipping away.\n\nThese practices turn onboarding from a churn bottleneck into a growth engine. Salesforce implementation leader GuideCX notes that by shortening time-to-value and optimizing engagement, companies \\*instantly experience their product’s benefits\\* and dramatically boost loyalty. In short, the sooner a user celebrates a win with your product, the harder it is for them to consider churning.\n\n  \n**The Hidden Risk of Losing Your Champion**\n\nEven great onboarding can be undone if the internal champion – the person who advocated for your solution – leaves or loses influence. Your champion is often the glue holding the deal together. According to ChurnZero, when a customer’s champion exits, about **51%** of those accounts will churn within a year. If the departing champion is a senior executive, the churn risk jumps to 65%. In other words, champion turnover is one of the biggest churn triggers.\n\nTo guard against this, **never rely on a single point of contact**. From day one, build a multi-threaded relationship inside the account. Engage not only the power user but also their manager, peers, and other stakeholders. This creates redundancy: if one person goes on vacation, changes jobs, or deprioritizes your project, others can carry the torch. As one customer success expert puts it, multi-threading (building multiple stakeholder connections) \\*creates resilience that keeps activations moving forward, even when key contacts … change roles\\*\n\nThink of it as \\**implementation insurance\\**: having 3–5 engaged contacts at different levels makes the account much stronger. GuideCX found that projects with five or more engaged stakeholders have significantly higher completion and on-time success rates. So in practice, map out 2–3 champions (user, technical, executive) and nurture all of them.\n\n  \nStrategies to Mitigate Champion Turnover\n\nYou can’t prevent someone from leaving a company, but you can reduce the fallout:\n\n* **Build Multi-Threaded Relationships:** As noted, involve multiple people from the start. Invite these stakeholders to kickoff calls, review meetings, and project updates. Share progress on common channels (email, Slack, or a shared portal) where everyone is looped in. This way, knowledge about the project isn’t siloed in one person.\n* **Monitor Account Changes:** Stay alert to red flags that a champion might be leaving. Watch for signals like LinkedIn updates, company news (reorgs/layoffs), or churn alerts in your CRM. If you hear a key contact is moving on, act quickly.\n* **Proactive Re-Onboarding:** When a new person steps into a champion role, treat it as an opportunity. Schedule a focused orientation: review what’s been achieved, how the product is solving problems, and what’s next. A clear, thoughtful handoff (often via a joint call with the old and new champions) can win the newcomer’s confidence and commitment.\n* **Align Sales &amp; Success Metrics:** Make retention everyone’s job, not just CS’s. For example, SmartReach linked sales commission to renewal outcomes – sales reps only get full bonus if customers are healthy at 6 months. This forces reps to think long-term: they won’t just focus on closing deals, but also on setting up a durable account structure. In practice, tying incentives to renewals encourages handoff planning and multi-threading before the contract ever starts.\n\nBy institutionalizing these tactics, the departure of one champion is far less likely to tank the account. When champion transitions do happen, your team can quickly rally the remaining stakeholders and get the new advocate up to speed.\n\n# 2025 Case Studies: Putting It All Together\n\n**SmartReach – Churn Down 35%:** SmartReach, a sales engagement SaaS, cut its annual churn from 27% to 17.5% (35% relative drop) in 12 months. They took a company-wide approach: refining their ideal customer profile (to avoid bad-fit deals), implementing real-time health scoring to flag at-risk accounts, and even restructuring sales comp to reward 6-month retention. On the product side, they let churn feedback drive the roadmap – for example, adding deeper CRM integrations that were repeatedly cited as a pain point. The result was that customers not only stayed longer, but expanded usage, showing that preventing churn took effort across sales, success, and product teams.\n\n**Ollie – From Launch Churn to Advocacy:** Ollie provides ERP software to craft breweries and used to suffer \\*failure-to-launch\\* churn: customers would sign up but never fully adopt the system. By partnering with a customer success platform (ChurnZero), Ollie rebuilt its onboarding. They used automated task lists and email nudges to guide new users, and CSMs now step in at each critical drop-off point. This data-driven process exposed common roadblocks, which Ollie quickly addressed with better guides and training. The impact was dramatic: many more breweries completed onboarding and hit their first success metrics. As ChurnZero reports, the new mix of automation and personal support transformed Ollie’s onboarding results, leading to lower churn and fewer failure-to-launch issues. Crucially, these satisfied users became advocates – many even recommended Ollie to peers, turning retention work into a source of word-of-mouth growth.\n\n\n\n# Proven Retention Tactics for 2025\n\nAcross SaaS today, the top retention strategies look remarkably consistent:\n\n* **Outcome-Driven Onboarding:** Move beyond generic tutorials. Map out the customer’s first key outcomes and build onboarding paths that achieve those. Automate helpful nudges along the way so users hit “quick wins.” The goal is to have every new user say \\*hey, this already helped me with X,\\* early on.\n* **Continuous Health Monitoring:** Don’t wait for renewal season. Use integrated analytics (health scores, usage dashboards, NPS surveys, etc.) to spot problems months in advance. Proactively intervene on any downward trend. SmartReach’s health-score system is one example – it enabled them to halve losses by acting on red flags immediately.\n* **Proactive Champion Management:** Constantly cultivate multiple champions. Create a “champion playbook” so that if the main contact vanishes, you immediately bring someone else up to speed. Schedule regular update calls that involve all key stakeholders. If you do see a change in champion, onboard the replacement quickly with a dedicated session.\n* **Sales-CS Alignment:** Break down silos. Tie sales quotas or bonuses in part to customer health or renewals. When sales understands they share accountability for churn, they’ll help onboard the customer right and set expectations properly. Many SaaS leaders now have joint KPIs or \\*customer success clauses\\* in sales contracts for this reason.\n* **Customer-Driven Roadmaps:** Use churn and feedback data to inform your product backlog. Every roadmap item should be evaluated with a \\*will this help customers succeed and stick around?\\* mindset. For instance, SmartReach dug into churn surveys, found missing CRM integrations were a recurring issue, and fixed them – directly turning a churn cause into a retention gain.\n\nThe common thread is: make retention **everyone’s** job, and bake value delivery into every process.\n\n# Final Thoughts: Make Retention Your DNA\n\nChurn isn’t just a Customer Success metric – it’s a signal of how well the entire company is serving customers. The most successful SaaS teams in 2025 treat retention as a core strategy from Day 1. They sell only to well-defined ideal customers, ensure rapid time-to-value, and build broad relationships inside each account. As research confirms, **keeping a customer is far cheaper than acquiring a new one** (often 5–25× cheaper). In concrete terms, investing in your first 90 days – a stellar onboarding and resilient account structure – yields massive dividends. Not only do you save revenue, but you unlock sustainable growth: retained customers expand, advocate, and drive net-new referrals. In short, the data and case studies agree – powerful onboarding and strong internal advocates are the key to slashing SaaS churn.\n\n**Sources:** GuideCX, Flatfile, ChurnZero, SmartReach, and other industry reports provide the data and examples cited above. These trusted sources underscore that outcome-driven onboarding and multi-threaded account management are indispensable for 2025 retention strategies. \n\n***Note: I'm not promoting any site—just sharing the latest insights backed by real industry data and examples.***"

What's interesting is how these two issues often compound each other - when your internal champion leaves during a rocky onboarding phase, you're basically screwed because there's no one left to fight for the product internally. One thing that doesn't get talked about enough is how payment friction plays into this early churn problem too. At my firm we've seen cases where customers are actually happy with the product but churn because their payment fails during that critical first 90 days and the retry process is janky. We use openpay to retry payments now, so we no longer have that issue. The timing issue is brutal because failed payments feel way worse to customers when they're still figuring out if your product is worth it.",

Champion loss during weak onboarding is a double hit, and you're spot on that **payment failures in the first 90 days** can quietly tank retention. It’s a phase where trust isn’t fully built yet, so even a small friction like failed billing can tip the scale toward churn.\n\nReally interesting to hear how Openpay helped you clean that up .....curious, did you also tweak retry messaging or flows (like softer language or in-app nudges)? That final mile of trust in the billing experience feels underrated but so vital.",
