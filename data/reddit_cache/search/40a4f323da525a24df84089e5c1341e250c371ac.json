    "selftext": "**(THERE IS NO PROMOTION IN THIS POST, JUST LOOKING FOR FEEDBACK)**\n\nHey everyone,\n\nI'm working on a startup idea and would love to get some honest feedback from people who deal with internal documentation and knowledge management daily. I am very passionate about knowledge systems. I have worked on several projects to address this issue in various companies, and I consistently encounter the same problems with internal knowledge bases, regardless of company size.\n\n**TL;DR:** I'm building a tool that acts like an AI librarian for your company's knowledge base. It doesn't just search; it proactively finds conflicting information, identifies knowledge gaps by \"listening\" to Slack &amp; GitHub, and helps keep docs up-to-date and trustworthy. This is built on top of a RAG layer, but the ability to search through data is just a side effect of the main problem I am trying to solve: having up-to-date, consistent, and easy-to-use internal knowledge bases.\n\n**The Problem I'm Trying to Solve**\n\nAt my last job, our Confluence was a wasteland. Searching for an answer to a simple question meant wading through a dozen pages, finding three conflicting versions of the truth, and having no idea which one was current. Essential knowledge was scattered across Slack threads, Google Docs, and GitHub READMEs. There was no single person responsible for keeping it all coherent (though many large companies do hire what are essentially wiki editors for their internal knowledge bases), so it slowly decayed. It felt like we were wasting hours every week just trying to find information we already had.\n\nA classic example: something isn't documented in the first place. \"Oops, we forgot to write down what tables the Fivetran migrations map to and from. I guess I'll now spend the next 20-30 minutes looking through the migrations and checking that against data in the database.\" (Forget it if the database is sharded, that's going to take forever to find the correct server the migration is coming from). After looking at Snowflake to see if the tables listed in the migration map match the data you expect, you can finally start doing the work you actually needed to do, and you most likely didn't update the docs to help your fellow developers.\n\n**My Proposed Solution: The AI Librarian**\n\nInstead of just another search tool that sits on top of the mess, I'm developing an \"AI Librarian\" that actively tends to the knowledge base. The core ideas are:\n\n* **Proactive Curation:** The system automatically detects and flags outdated documents, broken links, and conflicting information across platforms (e.g., a process described one way in Confluence, another in a GitHub README, and a third way in the code of a given repo that isn't even documented).\n* **Learns from Your Workflow:** It passively observes public Slack channels and GitHub PRs. If it sees the same question asked repeatedly, it suggests creating a new knowledge base article. If a PR changes how a feature works, it can suggest updating the corresponding documentation.\n* **Intelligent, Trustworthy Search:** It uses a RAG pipeline to provide direct answers to natural language questions, but crucially, **every answer comes with precise citations** and links back to the source documents or even the code so that you can trust the information.\n* **Data Sovereignty:** Recognizing that many companies can't use cloud-only tools, we're building a fully **self-hosted version** that can be deployed on-premises in an encrypted container. Hence, no data ever leaves the customer's network.\n\n**How is this different from tools like Guru, Slite, etc.?**\n\nMany existing tools are great knowledge bases, but they still rely heavily on manual curation. We're focused on being the proactive layer that works with your existing systems (like Confluence, Google Drive, or even Zoom) to keep them clean and reliable, reducing the manual maintenance burden.\n\n**I'd love your feedback on a few key questions:**\n\n1. **Is this a real pain point for you?** How much time do you or your team lose hunting for or validating information? How do you solve this now?\n2. **Does the \"AI Librarian\" concept resonate?** Is the idea of an AI proactively flagging outdated content and suggesting new articles useful, or does it sound too intrusive? Does the idea of a bot in Slack and GitHub responding to messages automatically (which would be configurable) seem helpful, assuming the information is accurate?\n3. **How important is self-hosting?** For your organization, is a secure, on-premises deployment option a \"nice-to-have\" or an absolute must?\n4. **What are your must-have integrations?** We're starting with Confluence, GitHub, Slack, Google Drive, YouTube, S3, Jira, and Zoom. What other tools are critical to your knowledge ecosystem (e.g., Trello, Notion, Gong)?\n5. **Pricing Gut Check:** Currently, I have a React-based demo with no backend, so we are far from being able to onboard new people. How much would you pay for this for yourself? How much would you pay per seat for an enterprise? If a product like this existed, would you recommend that your employer invest in it?\n6. **What am I missing?** What's the biggest flaw or potential risk you see with this idea?\n\nMy goal is not merely to capitalize on the AI hype by building another tool for a problem that doesn't exist. I am passionate about knowledge systems and want to solve real issues I've encountered in the past. I want to ensure I am not overlooking anything or creating something nobody wants.\n\nThank you so much for your time and insights. I'm here to listen and learn."

Additionally, these tools aren’t built with AI-first rather is (or would be) added as a bolt-on\n\n# Why now?\n\n* We can’t that deny AI will inevitably a part of our future educational and professional lives\n* I believe that most people are utilising this technology too much or the wrong way such that their actually offloading their thinking and becoming what I’ve heard to be an “LLM with extra steps”\n* IMO, a tool should exists that gives the user the ability to still **use AI to enhance their thinking and learning but not do the thinking for them**\n\n# The solution\n\n* Users would have the ability to extract their ‘gems’ of understanding from a regular ChatGPT like chat and store in our PKM, (note. this will be integrated in the app)\n* Similar to what obsidian does (manually), the AI would semantically match the gem to relevant ones and store in your knowledge base\n* When the user is curious about learning or storing something related (to the topic that was stored), AI will draw on the appropriate ‘gems of understanding’ to explain this new concept\n* This (hopefully) resurfaces prior understanding for the user and also helps enhance understanding of the new idea due to wider contextual awareness (strengthening both areas of knowledge)\n* I want to eventually extend this functionality, such that this product becomes the goto platform for someone who wants **teach themselves anything and** **have the best chance to retain that understanding long-term.**\n\n# I would love your input on…\n\n* Do you believe this learning method would work for you?\n* Do you see any direct flaws with this approach to learning?\n* Do you see any flaws with traditional note taking platforms, like Notion, Obsidian, OneNote, etc.?\n* Do you see yourself paying for a product like this?\n* Would it be uncomfortable for you to ditch your systems of learning"

I know it still needs work and may not be for everyone, but I think it’s powerful.\n\nA heads-up: bulk import from Pocket requires a paid sub, since the AI costs to support it are pretty high.

    "selftext": "Hey Reddit,\n\nI’m 36, originally from India and have been in the US since 2013 on an H1B visa. After a decade of dealing with corporate bureaucracy and soul-crushing tech sales (managing upwards and all that bootlicking—ugh), I finally got my green card in the summer of 2023.\n\nI’ve always hated trading time for money doing work I don’t care about. So, I’ve decided to take a leap. My wife and I are heading to India soon for six weeks with our 3-month-old baby. She quit her job in July, and we’ve been gearing up for a big shift in our lives.\n\nFinancially, we’re in a decent spot—we can cover our expenses for two years without dipping into retirement savings. With that safety net, I’m planning to leverage my knowledge of the US market, my network in India, and my background in tech and business to explore these three industries:\n\n1.\tLab-Grown Diamond Imports – Leveraging India’s expertise in diamond manufacturing and finding markets in the US.\n\n2.\tTextile Imports &amp; B2B Wholesale – Starting with Amazon FBA and eventually building a brand (long-term vision here).\n\n3.\tCountertop &amp; Tile Imports – Focused on B2B sales to US customers.\n\nI know these are all pretty different, but I’m hoping one of them clicks. I’m excited (and honestly, a little terrified) about taking the plunge into entrepreneurship after being in Corporate America my entire career.\n\nWish me luck! Am I crazy for leaving the relative “safety” of corporate America, or is this the leap I’ve always needed to take? Would love to hear your thoughts, advice, or success stories from anyone who’s done something similar!\n\n Edit : I am dropping 1 and 2- going all in on #3"
